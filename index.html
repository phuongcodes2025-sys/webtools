        <h2 id="why-web-development">Why Web Development?</h2>

        <p>I chose web development because it combines my interests in technology and creativity.
            The ability to build something from scratch and see it come to life on the web is incredibly rewarding.
            I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and finding innovative ways to improve user experience.
            Additionally, web development offers a wide range of opportunities for growth and specialization, which
            aligns with my long-term career goals.

            Another reason I am drawn to web development is the collaborative nature of the field.
            Working with designers, content creators, and other developers allows for a dynamic and enriching work
            environment.
            I believe that collaboration leads to better outcomes and fosters a sense of community among
            professionals.
            I am excited to be part of this ever-evolving industry and contribute to projects that make a
            difference.</p>

        <h2 id="Coding AIAI"> The Importance of Coding Skills in the Age of Artificial Intelligence </h2>
        <p>
            Knowing how to code is more important than ever in today’s era of artificial intelligence. AI is rapidly
            transforming industries, from healthcare to finance to everyday technology like chatbots and smart devices.
            Behind every AI system, there are lines of code that make the algorithms function and adapt. By learning to
            code, individuals gain the ability to not only use AI tools but also to create, customize, and improve them.
        </p>
        <p>Coding empowers people to turn ideas into real applications, understand how data is processed, and solve
            problems in innovative ways. In a world where AI is shaping the future of work and society, coding is no
            longer just a technical skill—it is a form of digital literacy that opens opportunities and ensures people
            can actively participate in the AI-driven generation..</p>

        <h2 id="learning-journey">Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>
            I decided to take this course because I see web development as a powerful skill in today’s digital
            world.
            The ability to build websites means being able to share ideas, create tools, and even build
            communities online.
            I want to gain the foundational knowledge that will allow me to move from being a consumer of the
            web to being a creator.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main goal in this learning journey is to become comfortable with front-end development and
            eventually expand into more advanced areas.
            I’m excited to work on projects that challenge me, such as building interactive websites, designing
            layouts, and exploring responsive design.
            By the end of the course, I hope to have both the confidence and the skills to bring my ideas to
            life on the web.
